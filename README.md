# Waide - An IDE based on Web Assembly
Waide is a C/C++ IDE that runs in the browser without any backend server. It is based on Web Assembly and uses the [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) for code editing. It is currently in a very early stage of development and is not yet usable.

## Why Waide?
Waide is a project that I started as a project for my Algorithms Lab and Database Lab courses. I wanted to create a C/C++ IDE that runs in the browser and does not require any backend server meaning that the IDE can be hosted on a static website and can be used without any internet connection.
